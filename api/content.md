# Content Registration

Content comes in two tracks: the **code track** (`ContentRegistry`, this page) and the **data
track** (TOML content packs, at the end). Both share one pipeline: declarations are collected
during startup and materialized into native content at the **registry freeze point**, after which
they are indistinguishable from vanilla content.

::: warning The registry freezes
Minecraft's registries freeze early in startup; afterward nothing can be added or removed. OML
materializes your declarations at that freeze point — after it (including at runtime) no new
content can appear. Declare content inside [`declareContent`](#declarecontent).
:::

## declareContent

Make the `@Mod` class implement `OMLContentProvider`, and the loader calls it before the game's
main logic starts:

```kotlin
@Mod(id = "my_mod", name = "My Mod", version = "1.0.0")
class MyMod : OMLModInitializer, OMLContentProvider {
    override fun declareContent(registry: ContentRegistry) {
        // declare here
    }
}
```

The registry is already bound to the mod's namespace: ids in declarations carry no domain, and OML
binds them under the mod id.

## Blocks

```kotlin
val block = registry.declareBlock("ruby_ore") {
    destroyTime = 3.0f
    explosionResistance = 6.0f
    requiresCorrectToolForDrops = true
}
```

| Property                      | Default               | Meaning                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `destroyTime`                 | vanilla default       | hardness (time to break)         |
| `explosionResistance`         | follows `destroyTime` | blast resistance                 |
| `requiresCorrectToolForDrops` | `false`               | drops only with the correct tool |

Every block automatically registers its block item. The returned `OMLBlock` exposes `platform`
(the native block object) once content registration completes — the escape hatch for
version-specific behavior.

### Behavior hooks

Blocks can carry declarative behavior hooks; their implementation is the version adapter's (it
materializes its own `Block` subclass), and your handlers are plain lambdas. The vanilla behavior
always still runs — a behavior block is a plain block plus hooks.

```kotlin
registry.declareBlock("trap_floor") {
    onStepOn { event ->
        if (!event.isClient) {
            // server side: apply damage, effects — via event.level / event.entity if needed
        }
    }
    onHit { event ->
        // a player just started breaking the block
    }
}
```

| Hook       | Fires                                                | Event                                                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `onStepOn` | every tick an entity stands on the block, both sides | `OMLStepOnEvent` — x/y/z, `isClient`, `level`, `entity`   |
| `onHit`    | a player starts breaking the block                   | `OMLBlockHitEvent` — x/y/z, `isClient`, `level`, `player` |

`level` and `entity`/`player` are the raw version objects — the same escape hatch as `platform`.
Gate gameplay effects on `isClient`: the hook fires on both sides.

### Block entities: machines

`blockEntity` gives the block a server-side tick and a **persistent data store** — the pieces a
machine is made of:

```kotlin
registry.declareBlock("press") {
    blockEntity {
        tick { event ->
            val progress = event.data.getInt("progress") + 1
            event.data.putInt("progress", progress)   // survives save/reload
        }
    }
}
```

- `tick` runs once per game tick while the chunk is loaded, **server side only** (the client never
  sees the event — a machine tick is a simulation concept).
- `event.data` is an `OMLBlockData`: primitive-typed key-value pairs (`int` / `long` / `float` /
  `double` / `boolean` / `string`) that persist with the world; writes mark the block entity for
  the next autosave.
- A block may combine behavior hooks and a block entity freely.

### World generation: ores

`generateAsOre` makes the block generate naturally as a vein. It materializes into datapack
worldgen files merged into the target biomes — like any datapack ore, **only newly generated
chunks** are affected:

```kotlin
registry.declareBlock("ruby_ore") {
    destroyTime = 3.0f
    requiresCorrectToolForDrops = true
    generateAsOre {
        veinSize = 8        // blocks per vein
        perChunk = 6        // placement attempts per chunk
        minY = 16
        maxY = 64           // trapezoid height distribution
        biomes += listOf("minecraft:forest", "minecraft:taiga")  // empty = every biome
    }
}
```

The vein replaces the stone family (`minecraft:stone_ore_replaceables`); an empty `biomes` list is
safe outside the overworld for the same reason — netherrack and end stone do not match.

## Items

```kotlin
registry.declareItem("ruby_sword") {
    maxDamage = 592
    attackDamage = 7.0
    attackSpeed = -2.4   // vanilla base 4.0 → effective 1.6
    miningSpeed = 1.0f
    toolDamagePerBlock = 2
    minesAndDrops("minecraft:stone", 8.0f)   // on stone: mining speed 8, drops loot
    overrideSpeed("minecraft:dirt", 4.0f)    // on dirt: mining speed 4, vanilla drops
    deniesDrops("minecraft:bedrock")         // never drops
}
```

| Property                     | Default            | Meaning                                                         |
|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `maxDamage`                  | none (unbreakable) | max durability; > 0 shows the durability bar                    |
| `attackDamage`               | none               | main-hand attack damage **modifier** (vanilla fists: 1.0)       |
| `attackSpeed`                | none               | main-hand attack speed **modifier** (vanilla base: 4.0)         |
| `miningSpeed`                | –                  | default mining speed when no rule matches (requires tool rules) |
| `toolDamagePerBlock`         | `1`                | durability cost per broken block                                |
| `canDestroyBlocksInCreative` | `true`             | instant breaking in creative mode                               |

Tool rule semantics: `minesAndDrops` = matched blocks mine at the given speed **and drop loot**;
`overrideSpeed` = speed only, vanilla drops; `deniesDrops` = vanilla speed, never drops. These map
onto the native `DataComponents.TOOL`.

## Recipes and drops

### Crafting

```kotlin
// shaped: 2x2 ruby from 4 ruby items (pattern rows reference the key map, ' ' = empty cell)
registry.declareShapedCrafting(
    result = "my_mod:ruby_block",
    pattern = listOf("RR", "RR"),
    key = mapOf('R' to "my_mod:ruby"),
)

// shapeless: any arrangement of the ingredients
registry.declareShapelessCrafting(
    result = "my_mod:ruby",
    ingredients = listOf("my_mod:ruby_ore", "minecraft:stick"),
    count = 2,
)
```

Pattern rules: 1-3 rows of 1-3 cells, all rows the same width, every non-blank character must have
a key entry — a malformed pattern throws at declaration time, before the pack ever loads. Bare
ingredient ids are qualified with the mod's namespace. The datapack file id derives from the result
(`my_mod:ruby_block` → `my_mod_ruby_block`); two recipes with the same result get a numeric suffix.

### Smelting

```kotlin
// smelting (furnace: SMELTING / BLASTING / SMOKING, default SMELTING)
registry.declareSmelting(
    input = "minecraft:raw_iron",
    result = "minecraft:iron_ingot",
    experience = 0.7,
    cookingTime = 200,
)

// drop override: breaking ruby_ore drops 1–3 ruby
registry.declareBlockDrop(block = "ruby_ore", drop = "my_mod:ruby", dropCountMin = 1, dropCountMax = 3)
```

Recipes and loot tables materialize into datapack JSON served through OML's injected resource pack —
the **vanilla datapack reload path**, server-authoritative and synced to clients.

## The data track: TOML content packs

Content without code: a pack's declarations live in `content.toml` at the root of an **`.oml` archive**
(a plain zip renamed — see the distribution section below for the layout). The archive name is the
namespace, and the pack declares blocks, items and recipes:

```toml
[block.ruby_ore]
destroy_time = 3.0
explosion_resistance = 6.0
requires_correct_tool = true

[item.ruby]
max_damage = 64
attack_damage = 2.0
# Tool rules are arrays of inline tables, one entry per block.
mines_and_drops = [{ block = "minecraft:stone", speed = 8.0 }]
override_speed = [{ block = "minecraft:dirt", speed = 4.0 }]

[crafting.ruby_block]
type = "shaped"
pattern = ["RR", "RR"]
key = { R = "ruby" }

[crafting.ruby_from_ore]
type = "shapeless"
count = 2
ingredients = ["ruby_ore", "minecraft:stick"]

[smelting.ruby]
input = "raw_ruby"
experience = 0.7
cooking_time = 100
# furnace = "blasting"   # smelting (default) / blasting / smoking

[loot.ruby_ore]
drop = "raw_ruby"
drop_count_min = 1
drop_count_max = 3
```

The fields map one-to-one onto the code API (`destroy_time` → `destroyTime`, …); `mines_and_drops`
and `override_speed` entries carry `block` and `speed`, `denies_drops` entries carry `block` alone.
A `[crafting.<result-id>]` section declares a crafting recipe whose result is that item: `type`
selects shaped / shapeless; shaped needs `pattern` (rows) plus a `key` inline table mapping
pattern characters to item ids; shapeless needs an `ingredients` list; `count` is optional (default 1). A
`[smelting.<result-id>]` section declares a furnace recipe (`input` required,
`furnace` selecting smelting / blasting / smoking, optional `experience` and `cooking_time`); a
`[loot.<block-id>]` section declares that breaking the block drops `drop` instead of itself. The
`ore` inline table on a block mirrors `generateAsOre` (`vein_size`, `per_chunk`, `min_y`, `max_y`,
`biomes`). Validation errors (ragged patterns, unknown types, missing fields) fail the pack
with the reason. TOML packs share
the same collect → freeze-materialize pipeline as code mods, and asset injection treats the pack's
namespace like a mod domain. A misspelled field is called out by name in the startup log — nothing
is silently ignored. What the data track does **not** cover: behavior hooks and block entities are
mod code and have no TOML form.

A loose `.toml` file dropped into `mods/` is **not** a pack form and is refused with an explicit
message: it cannot carry the pack's own textures, so its blocks would render with missing textures.
Ship the pack as an `.oml` archive.

## Distribution form: `.oml` archives

A content pack ships as a **`.oml` archive** (a plain zip renamed): `content.toml` at the root,
plus the pack's own `assets/` and `data/`:

```
MyPack.oml (zip)
├── content.toml
└── assets/
    └── my_pack/
        ├── textures/block/ruby_ore.png
        └── lang/en_us.json
```

Drop it into `mods/`. The archive name is the namespace; the archive's textures and lang files are
served through OML's injected resource pack.

## Hot reload

Recipes declared through the content tracks ride vanilla's datapack reload:

- **Textures / lang / models**: `F3+T` re-scans the mod jars and `.oml` archives — edited files are
  picked up on the spot.
- **Crafting / smelting recipes and loot**: edit the pack, then run `/reload` (or `F3+T`) — the
  loader re-reads the packs from disk and the datapack JSON is served fresh. Ore worldgen files
  reload the same way, but world generation itself only touches newly generated chunks.
- **Blocks / items themselves**: not reloadable. The registries freeze early in startup; adding or
  changing a block or item requires a restart. This is a vanilla constraint, not an OML limitation.
