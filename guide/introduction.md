# Introduction

**OhMyLoader (OML)** is a mod loader for Minecraft Java Edition: a self-developed bytecode
injection engine, a unified high-level mod API, and data-driven declarative content registration —
on both the client and the dedicated server. The current stable line is 26.3, and the whole stack
runs on Java 27.

## Design

### Unified semantic API

Mods program against high-level game semantics (events, lifecycle, content registration) and never
touch version internals. Cross-version differences are absorbed below the semantic layer, by the
per-version adapter, and never leak upward.

### Self-developed bytecode engine

The core ships its own lightweight bytecode surgery tooling, replacing the heavy SpongePowered Mixin
and Access Transformer layers:

- **Injection DSL**: anchors like `atHead` / `atReturn` / `beforeCall` combined with payloads like
  `call` / `modifyArg` / `redirectCall` — semantics aligned with Mixin, but purely declarative and
  self-checked at startup;
- **Mixin class merging**: `@Shadow` / `@Overwrite` / `@Unique` / `@Accessor` / `@Invoker` are all
  supported;
- **Annotation front-end**: developers used to Mixin can keep writing `@Mixin` / `@Inject`; the
  loader compiles the annotations into injection rules and runs them through the same pipeline.

Every rule is verified at startup — handler existence, staticness, signature consistency and match
counts. A wrong rule fails the launch, instead of silently doing one thing less in game.

### Thin adapters

Each game version gets one thin adapter module (`oml-adapter-*`) that only maps hook anchors and
native types. The current stable line is **26.3**; the latest snapshot is tracked separately by
`oml-adapter-snapshot`, which shares its whole implementation with the 26.3 adapter — landing the
26.4 official release is one shape check away, not a rewrite.

### Two content tracks

- **Code track**: declare blocks / items / recipes through `ContentRegistry`; they are materialized
  into native content at the registry freeze point;
- **Data track**: declare data-driven blocks and items in a `content.toml` inside a `.oml` archive —
  no code at all.

| [OhMyLoader](https://github.com/OhMyLoader/OhMyLoader)               | The loader: core, API, version adapters, installer, native library                  |
| [OhMyLoaderGradle](https://github.com/OhMyLoader/OhMyLoaderGradle)   | The official Gradle plugin: runtime assembly and `runClient` / `runServer`          |
| [OhMyLoaderTestMod](https://github.com/OhMyLoader/OhMyLoaderTestMod) | The end-to-end verification mod, consuming OML exactly like an external mod project |

The three repositories consume each other by Maven coordinate only. See the loader repository's
README for the module layout.


## API stability

The mod-facing surface comes in three tiers, contracted in the loader's
[`oml-api/README.md`](https://github.com/OhMyLoader/OhMyLoader/blob/main/oml-api/README.md):

- **Contracted**: the `@Mod` entry, `OMLModInitializer` / `ModContext`, `Events`, the content
  declaration DSL and the injection DSL — semantically backward-compatible; breaking changes are
  deprecated for one minor release first.
- **Provided, settling**: commands, config, network, key bindings / HUD / creative tabs — shipped,
  allowed to adjust until 1.0, changes recorded in the release notes.
- **Escape hatches**: everything a `platform` property hands you — the raw game objects, free to
  change with any game version, by design.
